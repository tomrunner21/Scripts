# Scripts
Finished Scripts and Projects from Google Colab and personal workspaces
They are scripts that webscraped different websites so I could easily input the data into Excel or ThinkorSwim.
Excel was used for Ebay and AuctionNinja so I could see the average prices that items on Auction Ninja were going for.
The FinViz is used to upload into ThinkorSwim to easily go through the top gainers quickly and see what's moving everyday before the data is deleted from their website.
